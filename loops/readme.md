# Loops
Loops are used when you want to something repeatedly for a certain amount of times. For example, if you want to print out "Hello World" 5 times, instead of literally printing it out for 5 times, you can use loops to do that.

## for-loops

<hr>

### Generic Syntax Form of for-loop

```
for(starting_value; condition;  increment/decrement){
    // do something
}
```

<ul>
    <li>starting_value is a place where you want to start</li>
    <li>
        condition is where as long as the condition is true, it'll go inside the loop and when it's false, it'll break out from the loop
    </li>
    <li>
        increment/decrement is the number of steps you want to increase/decrease
    </li>
</ul>

## while-loop

<hr>

### Generic Syntax Form of while-loop

```
while(condition){
    // do something
}
```

Just like the for-loop, as long as the condition is true, it'll go inside the loop and execute whatever the code inside but when false, it'll break out from the loop.

## do-while-loop

<hr>

### Generic Syntax Form of do-while-loop

```
do{

    // codes here

}while(condition);
```
It is similar to the while-loop but the main difference is do-while-loop doesn't check the condition for the very first time whilst the while-loop does.
