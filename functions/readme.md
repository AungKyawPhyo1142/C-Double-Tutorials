# Functions

A function is like a little helper that does something for us. Some helpers can do things and give us something back, while others just do things without giving us anything. There are several functions in C++, but there are two types of functions you have to know:
<ul>
    <li>void functions</li>
    <li>value-returning functions</li>
</ul>

## void functions

<hr>

A void function is like a helper that does something for us, but it doesn't give us anything back. It's like asking a friend to help you clean your room and they do it, but they don't give you anything after they're done. They just helped you out of kindness!

### Generic Syntax Form of void function
```
void function_name( ){

    // your codes here

}
```

## value-return functions

<hr>

A value-returning function is like a helper that does something for us and gives us something back as a reward for asking for help. It's like asking a friend to help you bake cookies and they do it, but they give you a cookie after they're done as a thank you for asking them to help.

### Generic Syntax Form of value-return functions

```
dataType_of_a_variable_you_want_to_return function_name( ){

    // your codes here

    return someting;

}
```
