# First Mini Project with C++

## Let's make a simple Restaurant Program

Here's what we're gonna do. Imagine you have a restaurant and you serve 3 types of food to customers: BBQ Pizza for 20$, sushi for 10$, and finally an orange juice for 5$. When a customer order a food, this program will calculate the total cost.
