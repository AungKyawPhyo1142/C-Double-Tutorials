# Variables and Data Types

## Variables
<hr>
You can think of a variable as a box that holds a certain thing. For example, let's say you have a box that you only put your toys, not your snacks, not your books, no others, only your toys. That is what basically a variable does in general.

## Data Types
<hr>
Data types are the types of a thing. See, in the above example, your box(variable) only holds toys(data type) which is a type of a thing. You can't put your books, your snacks, or others into this. There are several data types in C++ but here are some of them:
<ul>
    <li>int - integers (1,2,3,4,...)</li>
    <li>float - floating points (we can consider them as decimal values: 1.51, 2.35, 6.2,...)</li>
    <li>char - a single character ('a', 'c', 'b',...)</li>
    <li>double - it is kind of like float, but it is more precise</li>
    <li>string - series of characters ("Hello", "Good Morning",...)</li>
    <li>bool - boolean (true, false)</li>
</ul>
