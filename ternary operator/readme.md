# Ternary Operator
I'll assume you already knew if-statement at this point. So, Ternary Operator is similar to if-statements. Some even say it is a short-hand version of if-statement. However, I'm gonna make it simpler for you. It goes like this, "Is the condition true? If yes, do the first_statement. If not, do the second_statement.".

### Generic Syntax Form of Ternary Operator

<hr>

```
variable = (condition)  ?   firts_statement : second_statement;
```
